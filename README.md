# Ambition

### How does it work?

- Similar to SHINE
- 1 half-day per week for half a year
- Group project of 3 devs
- Create your own schedule
- Sprints (SCRUM)

### Warning!
#### Replace the .gitignore file with a Unity .gitignore when making a game.

# Procedure
1. Make your FDD.
2. Pitch to your teacher to get a GO. > You will get your repository.
3. Make your TDD.
4. Make your MoSCoW.
5. Fill your scrumboard with your moscow tasks.
6. Stand-up meeting.
7. Start your sprint.
8. Plan a sprint review with your teacher.
9. Do a review.
10. Do a retrospective.
11. Update your scrumboard.
12. Repeat step 7.

## Collect proof of work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (FDD.md, TDD.md, Test.md RETROSPECTIVE.md, REVIEW.md and any other document)
* Screenshots of your scrum board.
* Video of (or parts of) the working application.
* Screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.
* ...

## General planning
- The project takes 2 periods.
- You have 1 lessons to work on it each week.
- Each periode you do at least 2 reviews, and have 1 grading moment.
- **You will plan these reviews yourself with a teacher of choice.**

## FDD 
* Create an FDD
* Sort the features in a MoSCoW table

## TDD
Describe how your application is made (not what it does).
* What stack/framework/engine do you use, and what version?
* Will you be using OOP or design patterns and why?
* How do you plan on coding certain features?
* Link any tutorial videos/documentation that you plan to use.
* What external data does your application need? (database, api, save files)
* How will you release? (Build/platform/hosting) 
* What security measures or optimization strategies will you use?

## Scrumboard
* Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects` with these columns:
  * Backlog
  * Sprint backlog
  * ToDo
  * In progress
  * Done sprint 1, Done sprint 2, etc
* Fill your backlog (Tip: Add MoSCoW priority labels).
* Fill your sprint backlog with the tasks you want to do this sprint.

## Realisation
* Keep your scrumboard up to day.
* Occasionally document some progress with screenshots or videos.
* Push often with clear commit messages.
* Test regularly.
* Make your code readable and clean.
* Follow code conventions.

## Test
* Perform *at least* one test.
* You should perform a test relevant to your product.
* Your test should be documented and use a clear test format. (usertest, acceptance test, performance test, etc)
* For a proper test, get someone to test who is relevant to what you are testing. Don't just do it yourself.
* Document your findings and draw conclusions from it.

## Review
* Present the tasks that you have completed this sprint.
* Gather feedback that your client gives you.
* Discus what your priorities should be.
* Document the following:
  * What did you present?
  * What feedback did you get?
  * What do you plan to do with the feedback?
  * What are your priorities for next sprint?

## Retrospective
* Reflect on your progress and on how your planning went this sprint.
* Reflect on what should go differently.
* Document these reflections.

## Assessment
* After one periode you will be graded on your repository.
* You will perform at least one code review during the project.
* After the second periode you will perform a presentation for the class.

## Video of your work
Create a video of the working application:
* Before the assessment, you must create a video of the working application.
* The video should show the main functionalities of the application.
* Add the video to the `sintlucas` folder.
* Give the video a clear name, e.g. `video-startproject-your-name.mp4`.
